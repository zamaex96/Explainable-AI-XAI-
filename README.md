To incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) into your training process, we can use tools and libraries such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the model's predictions. 
SHAP values help in understanding the contribution of each feature to the model's output.
Here is how you can modify your code to include SHAP values for explaining the model's predictions:
1. Install SHAP:
   pip install shap
2. Modify the Training Script to integrate SHAP.

3. Key points:
   
 * SHAP Integration:
  The shap.DeepExplainer is used to interpret the model's predictions.
  A background dataset is used for the explainer, and SHAP values are calculated and visualized during the training process.

 * Summary Plot:
 *  shap.summary_plot is called to visualize the SHAP values.
 *  This provides insights into feature contributions.
This setup provides a basic integration of SHAP into your model training process, enabling you to gain insights into how different features affect the model's predictions.
You can further customize and extend the XAI component based on your specific needs and requirements.
